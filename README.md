## üéØ How Rarity Works

The `Rarity` value in the config is used as a **weight**, not a percentage. You **do not** need to make them add up to 100.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* Higher values = more likely to be selected.
* The actual chance is based on the **relative weight** compared to others.
* Example:

  ```json
  "Common":   { "Rarity": 80.0 },
  "Uncommon": { "Rarity": 15.0 },
  "Rare":     { "Rarity": 4.0 },
  "Legendary":{ "Rarity": 1.0 }
  ```

  Here, **Common** has an 80% chance because 80 / (80 + 15 + 4 + 1) = 0.80

---

## ‚ûï Adding New Rarities

Just add a new entry in the config following the same format:

```json
"epic": {
  "Name": "Epic",
  "Color": "#A020F0",
  "Rarity": 0.5,
  "DurabilityMultiplier": 2.5,
  "MiningSpeedMultiplier": 2.0,
  "AttackPowerMultiplier": 2.2,
  "PiercingPowerMultiplier": 2.0,
  "Effects": ["Thor"],
  "SupportedItems": ["*"]
}
```

Create as many rarities as you want and adjust their stats to balance gameplay your way.

---

## üöß Planned Features

* More **special effects** to diversify tool behavior.
* Advanced item filtering via `SupportedItems`.
* Rarity support for **armor, weapons, and non-tool items**.
